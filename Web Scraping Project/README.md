# Summary

This project is a beginner-friendly web scraping tutorial aimed at students who know basic Python but are new to working with HTML and data extraction. The goal is to teach how to scrape and clean data from a saved Wikipedia page listing basketball films.

Using Python and BeautifulSoup, the tutorial walks through how to open and parse an offline HTML file, extract movie data from the correct table, clean out footnotes, and organize details like director, producer, cast, and runtime. The final output is a structured CSV file ready for analysis.

The project uses a local HTML copy to keep the process consistent and avoid scraping Wikipedia live. It's a practical introduction to working with real-world web data in a repeatable and respectful way.
