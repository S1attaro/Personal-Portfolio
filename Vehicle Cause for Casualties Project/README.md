# Summary

This project looks at how weather and accident causes relate to the number of human casualties, using a Kaggle dataset with 10,000 traffic accident records. I focused on three columns: Weather Condition, Cause, and Casualties. The goal was to see if certain combinations, like speeding in the rain or reckless driving in fog, lead to more injuries or deaths.

The results showed no strong relationship. Differences in casualty numbers were small, usually less than 0.3, and the regression analysis didn’t find any significant patterns. One exception was reckless driving in fog, which showed a slightly higher average. The R² value was very low (0.000788), and p-values were high, so the model didn’t explain much.

This suggests that other factors like road conditions, location, or driver background might be more important. The project was done using Python and Excel, and while the data has its limits, it helped highlight areas for further research.
