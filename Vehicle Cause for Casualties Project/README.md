# Summary

This project looks at the relationship between weather conditions, accident causes, and the number of casualties using a dataset of 10,000 traffic accidents from Kaggle. I focused on three key variables: Weather Condition, Cause, and Casualties, and used basic statistical analysis and regression modeling to explore whether certain combinations—like speeding in rain or reckless driving in fog—led to more injuries or fatalities.

The results showed no strong correlation. Casualty differences between groups were minor (typically less than 0.3), and regression analysis returned high p-values and a very low R² value (0.000788), suggesting that weather and cause alone don’t significantly explain casualty outcomes. The most notable case was reckless driving in fog, which had slightly higher casualty averages.

While the findings were limited, the analysis highlights the importance of including more context—such as road conditions, driver history, or time of day—in future research. This project was completed using basic tools like Python and Excel and serves as a starting point for deeper investigation into traffic safety patterns.
