# Summary

This project looks at video game sales to understand how they vary by region, genre, and rating. I chose this dataset because I’ve been interested in games since childhood, and wanted to explore how games perform globally.

I compared sales across North America, Europe, and Japan, and looked at whether higher user scores lead to more sales. The data showed a weak correlation between user scores and global sales (r = 0.11), meaning ratings don’t strongly predict commercial success. Most games sold under 5 million units, with a few major outliers like GTA and Wii Sports skewing the average.

The results suggest that other factors like platform, genre, or marketing are likely more important. Future analysis with more detailed data could help explain what makes a game successful.
